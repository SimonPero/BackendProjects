## GitHub User Activity Fetcher - JavaScript

- [GitHub User Activity Fetcher](./github-user-activity/)
- This Node.js script fetches a GitHub user's activity from the GitHub API and filters the events based on the type of activity (e.g., `PushEvent`, `ForkEvent`). It provides a command-line interface (CLI) to display the activity details, including commits, repository names, and the event date.

## CLI Expense Tracker - JavaScript

- [GitHub User Activity Fetcher](./cli-expense-tracker/)
- This project idea is a great way to practice my logic building skills and learn how to interact with the filesystem using a CLI application. It also helps me understand how to manage data and provide useful information to users in a structured way.
